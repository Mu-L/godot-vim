# Building GodotVim from source

Build it yourself if your distribution's glibc is older than 2.34 so the
published Linux binary will not load, if you are on Linux arm64 which no release
ships, or if you want to change the plugin.

You need Rust 1.87 or newer on the stable channel, from
[rustup](https://rustup.rs), and a C toolchain for the linker: `build-essential`
on Debian and Ubuntu, the Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS, Visual Studio Build
Tools with the C++ workload on Windows. You do not need a Godot binary, clang,
LLVM, Python or SCons; the Godot bindings come from a prebuilt API description,
so there is no bindgen step. Every dependency is a public repository, so no
credentials and no GitHub account are involved.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hmdfrds/godot-vim
cd godot-vim
cargo build --release --locked
```

The library lands in `target/release/`: `libgodot_vim.so` on Linux,
`godot_vim.dll` on Windows (MSVC), `libgodot_vim.dylib` on macOS.

Then assemble the addon inside your own Godot project. This repository is not a
Godot project, and `addons/godot_vim/bin/` is gitignored, so it does not exist
after a clone. Substitute your own library name on Windows or macOS:

```bash
mkdir -p <your-project>/addons
cp -r addons/godot_vim <your-project>/addons/
mkdir -p <your-project>/addons/godot_vim/bin
cp target/release/libgodot_vim.so <your-project>/addons/godot_vim/bin/
```

The first `mkdir` matters. If `<your-project>/addons/` does not already exist,
`cp -r` renames the folder instead of copying into it, and you end up with
`plugin.cfg` one level too high and a plugin Godot never lists. The result should
be:

```
<your-project>/addons/godot_vim/
├── plugin.cfg
├── godot_vim.gd
├── godot_vim.gdextension
└── bin/libgodot_vim.so
```

Enable it in **Project Settings > Plugins** and restart the editor, the same as
any other install. The `.debug` and `.release` entries in the `.gdextension`
refer to the Godot build, not the Rust profile, so one artifact serves both.

**What to expect.** Roughly five minutes from a cold cache, about 700 MB in
`target/` and 210 MB in `~/.cargo`. Peak memory during the link approaches 3 GB,
because the release profile uses fat LTO with a single codegen unit. One warning,
`method get_text is never used`, appears in release builds only and is harmless.
Build with `--release`: a debug build of this library is about 190 MB and its
`target/` runs into gigabytes.

**What not to change.** Keep `--locked` and do not run `cargo update`.
`compact_str` is pinned to 0.7 to match the version vim-core exports across the
API boundary, and the reason is written above the dependency in `Cargo.toml`. Do
not change `panic = "unwind"` in `[profile.release]`; `src/safety.rs` catches
panics at every signal-handler boundary so a Rust panic cannot unwind across the
FFI into Godot, and that needs unwinding to exist.

**Platform notes.**

- `cargo build --release --target <triple>` writes to `target/<triple>/release/`,
  not `target/release/`. The release workflow always passes `--target`, so a path
  copied out of it points at a directory a plain build never creates.
- On Windows, close the Godot editor before rebuilding. Windows keeps the loaded
  DLL locked and the link step fails with `LNK1104`.
- On macOS a single-architecture build loads fine on your own machine. `lipo` is
  only needed to ship one file covering both:

  ```bash
  rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
  cargo build --release --locked --target aarch64-apple-darwin
  cargo build --release --locked --target x86_64-apple-darwin
  lipo -create \
    target/aarch64-apple-darwin/release/libgodot_vim.dylib \
    target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/libgodot_vim.dylib \
    -output libgodot_vim.dylib
  ```

- Under WSL, keep the clone on the Linux filesystem (`~/...`) rather than under
  `/mnt/c`, where DrvFs makes cargo's small-file work pathologically slow.
  `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` is not a factor here: cargo disables incremental
  compilation for release builds, and `lto = "fat"` with `codegen-units = 1`
  would defeat it anyway.

To work on the Vim engine rather than the plugin, use the `[patch]` snippet in
[vim-core's README](https://github.com/hmdfrds/vim-core#readme).
