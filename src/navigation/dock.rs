//! Vim-style j/k/h/l navigation within Godot's Tree, ItemList and
//! RichTextLabel dock controls, plus `/` to focus the dock's search box and
//! `ESC` to return to the code editor. Every one of these is reached by NAME
//! through an `ActionSpec`, resolved from the `dock` surface's binding trie —
//! the dispatcher does not know this file exists.
//!
//! # Where the keyset is now asserted
//!
//! This file used to carry P0's characterization suite: two hand-written
//! decision tables (`dock_action_for`, `search_action_for`) and their probe
//! walks, with no production caller, kept alive as an oracle for the
//! dispatcher cutover. The cutover shipped and was verified against the
//! pre-P0 dispatcher, so the oracles are gone. The behaviours they pinned are
//! stated against the live table instead — including the two asymmetries a
//! unified dispatcher is most tempted to erase, which are now
//! `resolve::a_dock_binds_no_modified_key_of_its_own` and
//! `resolve::a_filter_box_swallows_typing_and_breaks_its_seal_only_for_a_chord`.
